Assignment

CSE 112 Computer Organization
Introduction and Instructions

● This will be a group assignment, each student in the group will be marked separately.
Therefore try to make sure that work is roughly divided equally among all the members
of the group.
● In this assignment, you will have to design and implement a custom assembler and a
custom simulator for a given ISA.
● You are not restricted to any programming language. However, your program must read
from stdin and write to stdout.
● You must use GitHub to collaborate. You must track your progress via git.
● The automated testing infrastructure assumes that you have a working Linux-based
shell. For those who are using Windows, you can either use a VM or WSL.
● TAs will conduct a separate session to explain the whole assignment. They will
also show you the sample solution code and will explain to you how to run the
automated testing scripts.
● Start the assignment early and ask the queries well in advance. Do not expect any reply
on weekends and 7 PM - 7 AM on working days. Do not escalate your query to
instructors directly. Write any queries you have in the comments section. Wait at
least 24 hours before any reply to your comment. If there is no reply then you can mail it
to the respective TAs if still there is no response, then mail the TFs, and if still there is no
response, then mail the instructors.
● No last-minute deadline extensions will be considered whatsoever. This includes
but is not limited to connectivity issues, one group member not working or not
cooperating, a group member is/are getting sick etc. The duration of the deadline is
sufficient enough to complete the assignment.
● Commit your code to the repository periodically to prevent any loss of your code due to
system failures or any other issues. In case of system failures of all the members of the
group, your last committed code on github before the deadline will be considered for
evaluation.
